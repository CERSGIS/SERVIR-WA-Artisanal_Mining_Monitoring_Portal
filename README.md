# Artisanal Mining Monitoring Portal

## About
The galamsey monitoring portal was built on 100% open-source framework and libraries. The main frame work is Django which is a python-based framework. The map interface was developed using a JavaScript based library called leaflet js which helps render and visualize all the results.

All computations and querries are been processed using google earth engine python API . which sends results in a form of xyz tiles layer which can be rendered in the leaflet JS or json.
